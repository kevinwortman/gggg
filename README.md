Gradescope-Googletest Grading Glue (gggg)

This is a lightweight framework for Gradescope autograding of C++ programming assignments.

## Architecture

A gggg assignment involves several software services working together.

 * Canvas (or another LMS) announces the assignment to students, and records official grades.
 * GitHub Education manages a private repository for each student team. Each repository is initially a copy of a template repository, containing starter code, created by an instructor. Students submit work by pushing to these repositories.
 * Gradescope manages grading, including automated grading (autograding) and optional subjective grading. Gradescope pushes scores to Canvas.
 * GoogleTest may be used for graded code correctness tests.
 * This gggg project is the glue that connects these components.
   - An instructor specifies how a submission is graded by writing a short Python script, conventionally named `grade.py`. A `grade.py` script uses the `gggg.py` library, which defines an API for declaring submission and rubric policies.
   - Sample `Makefile`s have a `make grade` target. Students run `make grade` locally to preview their grade. The Gradescope autograde runs `make grade` to produce a score. 
   - The `make-autograder` program creates an `autograder.zip` demanded by Gradescope. An `autograder.zip` contains some very short scripts that tell Gradescope how to run `make grade` and find the score generated by `grade.py`.
